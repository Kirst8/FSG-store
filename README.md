Design
The design of the FSG store is a white with light blue and soft pink accents color scheme to fit in line with the entail website designed for the foundation
I personally prefer to create my websites with dark texts and avoid brighter colors as I feel it can impede on readability for the user.
I wanted the website to have a simplistic high contrast color scheme.
I wanted the website to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
I wanted the website to be accessible & responsive on all modern devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
I wanted a button scheme for users to easily navigate with a tap to different div sections (100vh/view height) on single pages.
Technology used
Frameworks
Bootstrap 4.6.0
My preferred CSS framework for this project because of the simple-to-understand documentation & simplicity of use.
jQuery 3.6.0
In an effort to keep the JavaScript minimal, I have decided to use jQuery as foundation to my scripts framework.
Django 3.1.0
Django is a free and open-source web framework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end Bootstrap4 CSS3 Framework and AnimateCSS Library.
Color Scheme
As I favor simplicity & high contrast over popping colors when designing a website, the color scheme used for this website is a simple  white with light blue and soft pink accents
 #fff
#00e6e6
#ffccff
White is the predominant theme of the website with black being reserved for button outlines & texts for extra readability. The white background also helps the product images pop out visually for the site visitors as they are mostly bright & colorful
Typography
Google Fonts were used across the site:
Montserrat : default font.
AnimateCSS : Animations used for heading on landing, team & athlete page.
Bootstrap : Typography / Colors Documentation from Bootstrap was used in various headings/texts/alerts around the site such as ".display-x" & ".text-success" classes.
 
Wireframes
Wireframes were used by balsamique and figma.
Balsamique was used to design the entail layout and figma was used to assist with the responsiveness of the images and navigation of the site set with the color theme
